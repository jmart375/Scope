## Project Scope

The project aims to secure the international structural design private cloud of Design World. The team will conduct a comprehensive security engineering review, vulnerability assessment, and penetration test to ensure the system's resilience against cyber threats. The project will adhere to assumptions, including a private cloud operated by a US company, virtual Intel-based systems, VPN access control, and remote work environments.

The scope of this project involved an assessment of the DW cloud environment, with a specific focus on system hardening. The primary objective was to equip DWâ€™s IT team with a well-defined roadmap for strengthening the security of their infrastructure. This road map encompasses an array of critical actions, including patching vulnerabilities, implementing security technical implementation guides (STIGS), updating software components, and mitigating high-risk issues detected within the virtual machines (VMs). The ultimate goal was to strengthen the resilience of the DW system against potential threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of crucial data and resources.
